    # Step 1: Check out your code from the repository
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    # Step 2: Configure CMake
    # IMPORTANT: This step reads your CMakeLists.txt and 
    # automatically downloads Google Test from the internet.
    - name: Configure CMake
      run: cmake -B ${{github.workspace}}/build

    # Step 3: Build the Executable
    # This compiles your code AND compiles the Google Test library
    - name: Build
      run: cmake --build ${{github.workspace}}/build

    # Step 4: Run the Tests
    # We use 'ctest' which is the standard CMake test runner.
    # --output-on-failure ensures you see the error message if a test breaks.
