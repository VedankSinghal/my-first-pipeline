    # We need 'lcov' to generate the HTML report

    # 2. Configure CMake with Coverage Flags
    # We add "-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=--coverage" to tell the compiler to track code usage.
    # We add "-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug" because coverage works best in Debug mode.

    - name: Build
      run: cmake --build build

    # 4. Run the Tests
    # This generates the raw .gcda data files
